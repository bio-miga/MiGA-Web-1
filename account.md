# Setting Up and Account

New users of MiGA On-line must register by going to [Miga Online](http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu:3000/) and setting up an account. Click on **Create User** and fill in the form with your name, email address and password. Then click on the **Create my account **button at the bottom of the page. Easy! and best of all, **free**!

After creating an account, when you log in to MiGA you will find a pull down menu in the upper right of the page with options for **Dashboard**, **Settings**, **Query datasets** and **Log out**. The Dashboard option will take you to your personal home page with links to some of the same things. The most important of these is Query datasets which will take you to a page with links to previous analyses you have made. The Settings link allows you to change your email address and password. 

Click on MiGA in the upper left to go back to the MiGA home page to start a new project or explore genomes in the databases.
